    <description type="string">Secure WebAccess (SWA) enables subscribers to securely access internal Company websites and web-based applications on the Company Intranet, as well as Jabber and email. SWA usually works from remote environments where the standard Employee Remote Access solutions do not and allows users to keep local-network connectivity while accessing Company resources. SWA is designed for employees who work at customer sites, not as a solution for general telecommuting. SWA does not offer the wide-open network connectivity that Employee Remote Access does, and should not be considered as a replacement for it.</description>
