    <description type="string">Monitors and captures the performance metrics of web pages that are viewable from the Internet. The monitoring process is designed to simulate the end-user experience by utilizing globally positioned agents that download all of the content of a webpage (code, frames and graphics) and record the time-to-render period for each component. This service not only captures and reports on performance and availability metrics from an Internet perspective, but also identifies errors on web pages and can send alerts via e-mail/pager if the designated performance thresholds are exceeded. Both single URLs (http and https) and business processes/transactions can be monitored.</description>
